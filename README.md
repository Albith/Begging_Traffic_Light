# Begging_Traffic_Light

A turn-based simulation where players live the life of a beggar living near a traffic intersection.  Beg for money, rest, search for a possible meal in the nearby dumpster, or buy a meal from the nearby restaurant.  Based on the characters and events observed in a traffic intersection in my hometown.
